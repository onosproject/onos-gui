# onos-gui Architecture
The GUI is architected as a Cloud Native application to be run on Kubernetes
accessing the back end modules through gRPC (and in the case of the Config GUI
mostly through gNMI).

![onos-gui deployment](images/onos-gui-deployment.png)

The main front end technology is [Angular](https://angular.io) and is
supplemented by [gRPC Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web) to access the back
through a gRPC proxy.

[Nginx](https://nginx.org/) acts as a web server and web Proxy, while
[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) proxy server acts as a grpc-web proxy and
all are deployed on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

While 2 proxies seem to be an overhead, it is unavoidable at present because:

* nginx cannot do the grpc-web proxying (while there was a
[module](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/tree/master/net/grpc/gateway/nginx) written for
nginx in the grpc-web project, this [does not work](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/issues/372#issuecomment-438045235)
with anything beyond nginx v1.14.2)

* Envoy cannot load static web pages, and so nginx is required to perform this role

## Alternatives to grpc-web
There are some alternatives to using grpc-web to allow web browsers to access
gRPC directly, but grpc-web is the recommended solution as per the gRPC [website](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/web/).

## Access to Kubernetes API
An instance of `kubectl proxy` runs inside the `onos-gui` pod alongside `nginx`.
This exposes the Kubernetes REST API on port 8001.

The `nginx` server then proxies that to http://localhost:80/kubernetes-api

The application can then access the API like:
```
HTTP GET http://localhost:80/kubernetes-api/api/v1/namespaces/onos/services
```

The `onos-gui` pod needs to be given RBAC permission of `list` and `get` to be able
to read these services. This is granted in the Helm Chart.
